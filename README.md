# Advertisements-Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple Linear Regression project using scikit learn

I have performed multiple linear regression in this project. The dataset consists of sales values based on TV, Radio and Newspaper advertisements in thousands. Here the target variable is Sales while the other variables form the predictor variable.
